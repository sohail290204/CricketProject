Boundary Bashers is a skill-based mobile cricket game developed in Unreal Engine 5 where players control a batsman by adjusting their position using a slider at the bottom of the screen and then swiping in one of three directions—straight, left, or right—to hit the ball. Unlike tap-to-hit cricket games, Boundary Bashers emphasizes precision and timing, as the player must be properly aligned and react quickly to hit boundaries. With its unique control scheme and dynamic swipe mechanics, the game offers an engaging and challenging experience for cricket fans who enjoy more interactive and reflex-driven gameplay.
